Appwrite Cloud backups are now considerably faster, reducing wait times and improving reliability.

## What's changed

We made key changes to the backup infrastructure by moving data reading operations inside the network, and implementing I/O optimizations for storage operations.

Internal testing revealed notable time savings across database backups:

- **3 minute backup → 1.5 minutes** (2x faster)
- **3.5 minute backup → 1.2 minutes** (3x faster)
- **6.7 minute backup → 2 minutes** (3.4x faster)
- **25.8 minute backup → 8.7 minutes** (3x faster)

Most databases showed at least a 2x reduction in backup time, with many achieving up to 7x faster backups depending on size and structure.

These optimizations improve the efficiency of data recovery and management. Your actual performance gains may vary depending on database size and structure.
