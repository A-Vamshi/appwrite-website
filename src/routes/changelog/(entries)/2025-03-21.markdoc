Appwrite Cloud backups are now dramatically faster, reducing wait times and improving reliability with impressive performance gains.

## What's changed

We made key changes to our backup infrastructure by moving data reading operations inside our network, and implementing I/O optimizations for storage operations.

Our internal testing revealed dramatic time savings across our database backups:

- **20+ hour backup → 30 minutes** (42x faster)
- **7 hour backup → 15 minutes** (26x faster)
- **18 minute backup → 8 seconds** (136x faster)
- **3 minute backup → 11 seconds** (17x faster)

Most databases showed at least 50% reduction in backup time, with many achieving 70-85% faster backups.

These optimizations drastically improve the efficiency of data recovery and management. Your actual performance gains may vary depending on database size and structure.
