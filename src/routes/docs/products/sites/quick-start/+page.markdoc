# Start with Sites

You can create and execute your first Appwrite Site in minutes.

## Create site

Before deploying your web app with Git, create a new Site attached to your GitHub repository.

![Create Site from GitHub repo](https://warm-tray-285.notion.site/image/attachment%3A59cff292-50e7-4bc9-b38a-497cc71eb780%3Aimage.png?table=block&id=1bafb53f-e82d-808e-a703-d7730947593f&spaceId=cf760f55-c352-4759-b494-006b8b294dbb&width=1420&userId=&cache=v2)

1. In the Appwrite Console's sidebar, click **Sites**.
2. Click **Create site**.
3. After clicking on **Connect Git repository**, select your repository.
4. After connecting to GitHub, add a **name** and site ID.
5. Follow the step-by-step wizard and create the site.
6. The site will be created, and a build will begin. Once the build is completed, you'll have created your first site. You can use your site's **domain** to access the deployment.
